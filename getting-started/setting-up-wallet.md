# Setting Up a Wallet \ud83d\udd10

## Your Digital Wallet: The Key to Bitcoin Ownership

A Bitcoin wallet is like a digital bank account that only you control. It's where you'll store, send, and receive Bitcoin. Let's set one up together!

## Understanding Bitcoin Wallets

### What a Wallet Really Is

A Bitcoin wallet doesn't actually "store" Bitcoin. Instead, it:
- **Manages your private keys** (secret passwords)
- **Tracks your balance** on the blockchain
- **Creates transactions** when you send Bitcoin
- **Generates addresses** for receiving Bitcoin

Think of it as:
> Your wallet = Your keychain üîë
> Your keys = Access to your Bitcoin üè¶
> The blockchain = The vault where Bitcoin lives üèõÔ∏è

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Your First Wallet

Let's set up **BlueWallet** as an example (process is similar for others):

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. **iOS**: Search "BlueWallet" in App Store
2. **Android**: Search "BlueWallet" in Google Play
3. Verify the developer is "BlueWallet Services, S.R.L."
4. Download and install

### Step 2: Create Your First Wallet

1. Open BlueWallet
2. Tap "Add wallet"
3. Choose wallet type:
   - **Bitcoin** - For regular transactions
   - **Lightning** - For instant small payments
4. Name your wallet (e.g., "My First Bitcoin")
5. Tap "Create"

### Step 3: Secure Your Wallet üö® CRITICAL STEP! üö®

#### **Write Down Your Seed Phrase**

Your wallet will show 12-24 words. This is your **seed phrase** or **recovery phrase**.

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Write it on paper (never digital!)
- ‚úÖ Store in a safe place
- ‚úÖ Make multiple copies
- ‚úÖ Keep it private forever

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Screenshot it
- ‚ùå Email it
- ‚ùå Store in cloud
- ‚ùå Share with ANYONE

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Anyone with these words can steal your Bitcoin! Treat them like the key to a safe full of cash.

### Step 4: Verify Your Backup

Most wallets will:
1. Ask you to confirm you wrote it down
2. Quiz you on specific words
3. Make you re-enter some words

**Take this seriously!** If you lose your phone and don't have your seed phrase, your Bitcoin is gone forever.

### Step 5: Set Additional Security

#### **Enable PIN/Password**
1. Go to wallet settings
2. Set a PIN or password
3. Use something memorable but secure

#### **Enable Biometrics**
1. Turn on Face ID/Touch ID
2. Adds convenience without sacrificing security

#### **Enable 2FA (if available)**
Some wallets offer two-factor authentication

### The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

## Creating Your First Bitcoin Address

1. Tap "Receive" in your wallet
2. You'll see:
   - A long string of letters/numbers
   - A QR code
3. Share this to receive Bitcoin
4. Each address is unique and yours

### Address Format Examples:
- **Legacy**: Starts with "1"
- **SegWit**: Starts with "3"
- **Native SegWit**: Starts with "bc1"

All work fine - newer formats have lower fees!

1. Get a few satoshis from a "faucet" (free Bitcoin for testing)
