                                    Recipient Receives!
```

### Transaction Components

Every Bitcoin transaction includes:
1. **Input**: Where Bitcoin comes from (your address)
2. **Output**: Where Bitcoin goes (recipient's address)
3. **Amount**: How much to send
4. **Fee**: Payment to miners for processing

## Step-by-Step: Sending Bitcoin

### Step 1: Get Recipient's Address

The recipient needs to provide their Bitcoin address. They can:
- **Show QR code** (easiest)
- **Copy/paste address** (careful!)
- **Send via secure message**

#### Address Formats:
- **Legacy**: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
- **SegWit**: 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy
- **Native SegWit**: bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq

All formats work - newer ones have lower fees!

### Step 2: Open Send Function

In your wallet:
1. Tap "Send" or paper airplane icon
2. Choose Bitcoin (not Lightning)
3. You'll see send screen

### Step 3: Enter Recipient Address

**Method 1: QR Code (Recommended)**
1. Tap QR scanner icon
2. Point at recipient's QR code
3. Address fills automatically
4. Verify it looks correct

**Method 2: Copy/Paste**
1. Copy address from recipient
2. Paste in address field
3. **Triple-check** every character
4. Look for validation checkmark

### Step 4: Enter Amount

- **BTC**: 0.00012345
- **Satoshis**: 12,345
- **Your currency**: $50

Tips:
- Wallet shows your balance
- Can't send more than you have
- Leave some for fees!

### Step 5: Set Transaction Fee

Fees determine speed:

| Fee Level | Speed | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| üêå Low | Hours/Days | Not urgent |
| üö∂ Medium | 30-60 min | Normal use |
| üèÉ High | 10-20 min | Time sensitive |
| üöÄ Priority | Next block | Urgent |

Most wallets suggest appropriate fees!

### Step 6: Review Everything

Before confirming, check:
- ‚úÖ Correct recipient address
- ‚úÖ Right amount
- ‚úÖ Acceptable fee
- ‚úÖ Total makes sense

### Step 7: Send!

1. Tap "Send" or "Confirm"
2. Enter PIN/biometrics if required
3. Transaction broadcasts to network
4. You'll see confirmation screen

### Step 8: Track Your Transaction

Your wallet shows:

## Understanding Confirmations

### What Are Confirmations?

Each new block added after your transaction = 1 confirmation

- **0 confirmations**: Pending (waiting for miners)
- **1 confirmation**: In blockchain (~10 minutes)
- **3 confirmations**: Very secure
- **6 confirmations**: Irreversible

### Why Wait for Confirmations?

- Small amounts: 1 confirmation usually fine
- Large amounts: Wait for 3-6
- Exchanges: Often require 3-6
- Personal choice based on trust

## Common Transaction Scenarios

### Sending to Friend
1. Meet in person or video call
2. They show QR code
3. You scan and send
4. Both see confirmation

### Paying for Goods/Services
1. Merchant provides address/invoice
2. Often includes exact amount
3. May have time limit
4. Save receipt/transaction ID

### Exchange Deposit
1. Generate deposit address on exchange
2. **Verify correct network** (Bitcoin, not others)
3. Send from wallet
4. Wait for exchange confirmations

### Testing New Wallet
1. Send minimum amount first
2. Verify it arrives
3. Test recovery if needed
4. Then send larger amounts

## Transaction Fees Explained

### What Determines Fees?

Fees based on:
- **Transaction size** (bytes, not Bitcoin amount)
- **Network congestion**
- **Desired speed**

NOT based on:
- Amount being sent
- Distance to recipient
- Wallet being used

### Fee Saving Tips
- Use Native SegWit addresses (bc1...)
- Send during low-congestion times
- Batch multiple payments together
- Consider Lightning for small amounts

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Insufficient Balance"
- Check you have enough for amount + fee
- Wallet might be calculating conservatively
- Try reducing amount slightly

### "Invalid Address"
- Recheck every character
- Ensure it's a Bitcoin address
- Some wallets only accept certain formats

### "Transaction Stuck"
If fee too low:
- Wait - it may confirm eventually
- Use RBF (Replace-By-Fee) if available
- CPFP (Child-Pays-For-Parent) advanced option
- Learn for next time

### "Sent to Wrong Address"
- Cannot be reversed üòî
- Contact recipient if possible
- Expensive lesson learned
- Always double-check!

## Advanced Features

### Replace-By-Fee (RBF)
- Increase fee after sending
- Speeds up stuck transaction
- Not all wallets support

### Coin Control
- Choose specific UTXOs to spend
- Advanced privacy feature
- For experienced users

### Batch Transactions
- Send to multiple addresses
- Saves on fees
- Business use case

## Security During Transactions

### Always:
- ‚úÖ Verify address character-by-character
- ‚úÖ Start with test transaction
- ‚úÖ Use secure internet connection
- ‚úÖ Check wallet is authentic

### Never:
- ‚ùå Send to address from email
- ‚ùå Trust "refund" addresses
- ‚ùå Send under pressure
- ‚ùå Ignore warning messages

## After Your Transaction

### Save Records
- Transaction ID
- Recipient address  
- Amount and fee
- Purpose/notes

### Confirm Receipt
- Ask recipient to confirm
- Check blockchain explorer
- Wait for confirmations

### Learn and Improve
- What went well?
- What was confusing?
- How can you improve?

1. Send $1 to yourself
